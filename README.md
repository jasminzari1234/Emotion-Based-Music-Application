# Emotion-Based-Music-Application

Music plays a very important role in human's daily life and in the modern advanced technologies. Usually, the user has to face the task of manually browsing through the playlist
of songs to select. Recent studies confirm that humans respond and react to music and that music has a high impact on personâ€™s brain activity. People tend to listen to music based on their mood and interests. Music listeners, collectors or psychologists may use mood wise music widely to categorize their music collection, or help soothe their clients. Despite such extensive use, this field of research is unexplored by many, thus classification task becomes much more difficult, yet important. This project focuses on creating an application to suggest songs for user based on their mood by capturing facial expressions. Once the emotion is recognized, the application suggests a play-list for that emotion, saving a lot of time for a user over selecting and playing songs manually.
